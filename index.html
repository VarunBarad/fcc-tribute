                            Son Goku (孫 悟空, Son Gokū), born Kakarot (カカロット, Kakarotto), is a male Saiyan and the main
                            protagonist of the Dragon Ball metaseries created by Akira Toriyama.
                            He is the adoptive grandson of Grandpa Gohan, the son of Bardock and Gine, the younger
                            brother of Raditz, the husband of Chi-Chi, the father of Gohan and Goten, the grandfather of
                            Pan, and later the ancestor of Goku Jr.
                            Cheerful, tenacious and also a bit naive, Goku is a Saiyan originally sent to Earth as an
                            infant with the mission to destroy it.
                            However, an accident alters his memory, causing him to grow up pure-hearted and later become
                            Earth's greatest defender, as well as the informal leader of the Z Fighters.
                            Throughout his life, he trains hard and constantly strives to be the greatest warrior
                            possible and to fight stronger opponents, which has kept the Earth and the Universe as a
                            whole safe from destruction many times.

                            Goku is a character which teaches all of us some very important things.
                            He taught us that, <em>One can always surpass even the toughest of enemies only if one is
                            willing to put in the work.</em>
